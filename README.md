Koken Typography
================

Plugin for [Koken](http://koken.me/) using the [PHP-Typography](http://kingdesk.com/projects/php-typography/) and the [Smartypants typographer](http://michelf.ca/projects/php-smartypants/typographer/)library. Modified for french text with specific options set in php-typography, and inclusion of Smartypants for the non breaking space before double punctuation.

## From the PHP-Typography description:
PHP Typography is a PHP based solution to greatly improve web typography. It features the following capabilities (including granular control):

- Hyphenation
- Spacing control, including: gluing values to units, widow protection, and forced internal wrapping of long URLs & email addresses.
- Intelligent character replacement, including smart handling of: quote marks ( “foo” ), dashes ( foo – bar ), ellipses ( … ), trademarks ( ™ ), math symbols ( 1024×768 ), fractions ( 12⁄23 ), and ordinal suffixes ( 3rd )
- CSS hooks for styling: ampersands (class “amp”), acronyms (class “caps”), numbers (class “numbers”), initial single quotes (class “quo”), and initial double quotes & guillemets (class “dquo”).

This project merges, builds upon, and generalizes the functionality of wp-​​Typogrify, wp-​​Hyphenate and SmartyPants.

## From the Smartypants typographer description:
Typographer is an extension to SmartyPants adding support for different quotation marks as well as for converting normal spaces to unbreakable spaces and thus preventing inappropriate line breaks.
